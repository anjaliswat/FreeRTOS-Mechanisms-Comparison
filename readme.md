The goal of this project was to see the impact of Synchronization overhead of different mechanisms into program runtime.

The simplest way to compare this was by measuring the time difference between two known points of a program.

In order to achieve this, the test program structure must be the same across all the implementations regardless of the specific function calls used for each. In our test setup we implemented this using a 7-way relay.
